# Reviewing Policy Gradient methods

>Continuous states and actions in high dimensional spaces cannot be treated by most off-the-shelf reinforcement learning approaches. Policy gradient methods differ significantly as they do not suffer from these problems in the same way. For example, uncertainty in the state might degrade the performance of the policy (if no additional state estimator is being used) but the optimization techniques for the policy do not need to be changed. Continuous states and actions can be dealt with in exactly the same way as discrete ones while, in addition, the learning performance is often increased. Convergence at least to a local optimum is guaranteed (**critical for robotics**).

>The advantages of policy gradient methods for real world applications are numerous. Among the most important ones are that the policy representations can be chosen so that it is meaningful for the task and can incorporate domain knowledge, that often fewer parameters are needed in the learning process than in value-function based approaches and that there is a variety of different algorithms for policy gradient estimation in the literature which have a rather strong theoretical underpinning. Additionally, policy gradient methods can be used either model-free or model-based as they are a generic formulation.

Policy gradient methods however,
> are by definition on-policy (note that tricks like importance sampling can slightly alleviate this problem) and need to forget data very fast in order to avoid the introduction of a bias to the gradient estimator. Hence, the use of sampled data is not very efficient. In tabular representations, value function methods are guaranteed to converge to a global maximum while policy gradients only converge to a local maximum and there may be many maxima in discrete problems. Policy gradient methods are often quite demanding to apply, mainly because one has to have considerable knowledge about the system one wants to control to make reasonable policy definitions. Finally, policy gradient methods always have an open parameter, the learning rate, which may decide over the order of magnitude of the speed of convergence, these have led to new approaches inspired by expectation-maximization (see, e.g., Vlassis et al., 2009; Kober & Peters, 2008).

The sequence of states and actions forms a trajectory denoted by <img src="https://rawgit.com/vmayoral/basic_reinforcement_learning/master//tutorial12/tex/85e4a233f33b0a54f2020db13ef59cc6.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=109.53294pt height=24.65759999999998pt/> where <img src="https://rawgit.com/vmayoral/basic_reinforcement_learning/master//tutorial12/tex/7b9a0316a2fcd7f01cfd556eedf72e96.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=14.999985000000004pt height=22.46574pt/> denoted the horizon which can be infinite.

The general goal of policy optimization in reinforcement learning for robots is to optimize the policy parameters <img src="https://rawgit.com/vmayoral/basic_reinforcement_learning/master//tutorial12/tex/1995b01bb3050d9d9821e07ddcbe14e8.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=51.988530000000004pt height=27.656969999999987pt/> so that the expected return is optimized:

 For real-world applications, we require that any change to the policy parameterization has to be smooth as drastic changes can be hazardous for the actor as well as useful initializations of the policy based on domain knowledge would otherwise vanish after a single update step. For these reasons, policy gradient methods which follow the steepest descent on the expected return are the method of choice. These methods update the policy parameterization according to the gradient update rule

### Vanilla Policy Gradient

The main problem in policy gradient methods is to obtain a good estimator of the policy gradient <img src="https://rawgit.com/vmayoral/basic_reinforcement_learning/master//tutorial12/tex/26cffbf0e87b9aec1aa3d9539f35712c.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=80.59755pt height=24.65759999999998pt/> In robotics, people have traditionally used deterministic model-based methods for obtaining the gradient however, this approach does not scale well as one needs to be able to model every detail of the system. Alternatively, we can estimate the policy gradient simply from data generated during the execution of a task, i.e., without the need for a model. The most prominent approaches for policy gradient estimation, which have been applied to robotics are: finite-difference and likelihood ratio methods (better known as REINFORCE in the RL community). According to (cite PG methods paper), of these two, the latter has a variety of advantages in comparison to finite difference methods when applied to robotics.

In likelihood ration methods we assume that trajectories <img src="https://rawgit.com/vmayoral/basic_reinforcement_learning/master//tutorial12/tex/0fe1677705e987cac4f589ed600aa6b3.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=9.046950000000002pt height=14.155350000000013pt/> are generated from a system by roll-outs, i.e., <img src="https://rawgit.com/vmayoral/basic_reinforcement_learning/master//tutorial12/tex/160a51dd5dc4e05542d6540b3c1f29b7.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=143.45627999999996pt height=24.65759999999998pt/> with return <img src="https://rawgit.com/vmayoral/basic_reinforcement_learning/master//tutorial12/tex/7e5e6666f565f8014687f70d73f24885.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=127.90552499999997pt height=27.656969999999987pt/> which leads to <img src="https://rawgit.com/vmayoral/basic_reinforcement_learning/master//tutorial12/tex/1f13a97e44eb6dfb4b61566c3a5b3ca7.svg?invert_in_darkmode" align=middle width=246.778455pt height=26.48447999999999pt/>. In this case, the policy gradient can be estimated using the likelihood ratio (see e.g. Glynn, 1987; Aleksandrov, Sysoyev, and Shemeneva, 1968) better known as REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) trick, i.e., by using:

2. For iteration=1,2,... do
    2.1 Collect a set of trajectories by executing the current policy
    2.2 At each timestep in each trajectory, compute
        2.2.1 the return $R_t = \sum_{t'=t}^{T-1} \gamma^{t'-t}r_{t'}$ and
        2.2.2 the advantage estimate $\hat{A_t} = R_t - b(s_t)$.
    2.3 Re-fit the baseline (recomputing the value function) by minimizing
        $|| b(s_t) - R_t||^2$, summed over all trajectories and timesteps.
    2.4 Update the policy, using a policy gradient estimate $\hat{g}$,
        which is a sum of terms
            $\nabla_\theta log\pi(a_t | s_t,\theta)\hat(A_t)$
