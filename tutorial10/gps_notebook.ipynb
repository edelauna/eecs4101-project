    "# Guided Policy Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Guided Policy Search (GPS) is a technique that transforms the Reinforcement Learning (RL) task of policy search into a Supervised Learning problem, where the training set is generated by a simple trajectory-centric RL algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm optimizes linear-Gaussian controllers $p_i (u_t | x_t)$. Each $p_i (u_t | x_t)$ succeeds in the task from different initial states which helps the algorithm to generalize to other states from the same distribution. The final policy $\\pi_\\theta(u_t | o_t )$ learned with GPS is only provided with observations $o_t$ of the full state $x_t$, and assumed dynamics are assumed to be unknown. \n",

    "We draw sample trajectories $\\tau_i^j$ for each initial state on the physical system by running the corresponding controller $p_i(u_t | x_t)$. The samples are used to fit the dynamics $p_i (x_{t+1} | x_t, u_t)$ that are used to improve the controllers $p_i(u_t | x_t)$, and serve as training data for the policy $\\pi_\\theta(u_t | o_t )$. Within the graph we can observe how there's a loop that alternates between optimizing each \n",
